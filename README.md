</p>
## 📘 Overview
This project analyzes customer support ticket data to evaluate performance, identify service gaps, and improve customer satisfaction.  
Using **Python** for data cleaning and **Tableau** for visualization, it delivers a dashboard with key insights into customer support efficiency.

---

## 🧠 Objectives
- Evaluate support team efficiency and customer satisfaction  
- Measure KPIs like resolution time, response rate, and satisfaction score  
- Build an interactive Tableau dashboard for visualization  
- Enable data-driven decisions to enhance service quality  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Tableau:** Dashboard, KPI Cards, Filters, Trend Charts  
- **Excel/CSV:** Data Source  

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning (Python)
Performed using `pandas`:
- Removed duplicates and handled missing values  
- Standardized data formats (Date, Time, Gender, etc.)  
- Created derived metrics (e.g., Average Resolution Time, Response Time)  
- Encoded categorical variables  

---

## 📊 Visualization (Python)
Explored trends before Tableau visualization using:
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for bar, pie, and line plots  
- Insights on ticket priority, status, and customer satisfaction  

---

## 📈 Tableau Dashboard
The **Tableau Dashboard** includes:
- KPI Cards → Total Tickets, Avg Resolution Time, Avg Satisfaction  
- Charts → Ticket Trend by Date, Channel, and Priority  
- Filters → Ticket Type, Gender, and Date Range  
- Distribution of satisfaction by age group  


---

## 🪄 Key Insights
- Most tickets are generated via **Email** and **Phone** channels  
- **Medium Priority** tickets take the longest to resolve  
- Average **Customer Satisfaction** ≈ 3.0  
- Around **33% of tickets remain open**
